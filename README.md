Schedule Bucket
==============

A simple, Kanban-like task management platform built with jQuery, PHP, MySQL. Easily track progress and todo tasks using the Schedule Bucket card system.

Schedule Bucket was a small side project I worked on for a few weekends in 2009 to learn to design event driven AJAX applications and the jQuery framework. Many users joined the early adopters email list, but I didn't get enough traction to be willing to continue the project. I never built out the premium plan, so it's extremely basic and likely riddled with bad code; I simply didn't want to see it completely wasted, so feel free to use the code/platform in your projects (personal and commercial) under the terms of the [New BSD License](LICENSE). Just please improve it first!--and pull requests would be greatly appreciated!

**Warning:** This really isn't production grade code, it was simply a crude experiment to improve my skillset. You've been warned. &nbsp; : )
