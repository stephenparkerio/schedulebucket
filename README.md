Schedule Bucket
==============

A simple, Kanban-like task management platform built with jQuery, PHP, MySQL. Easily track progress and todo tasks using the Schedule Bucket card system.

Schedule Bucket was a small side project I worked on for a few weekends in 2009 to learn to design event driven AJAX applications and the jQuery framework. Many users joined the early adopters email list, but I didn't get enough traction to be willing to continue the project. Please feel free to use the code/platform in your projects (personal and commercial) under the terms of the [New BSD License](LICENSE). Pull requests greatly appreciated!

The project site can be found at [http://schedulebucket.com](http://schedulebucket.com).
